Data Scientist and Researcher with both industrial and academic research experience in Machine learning and
Deep learning. I'm especially fascinated about deep learning inspired computer vision but I'm also keen to dive into classical
Computer Vision. My experience involves applications of Deep learning to Speech Recognition and Computer Vision both. With
these skills, I have assisted my organisations in improving the user experience of their products and services.
